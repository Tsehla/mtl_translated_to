Chapter 1: The Apprentice's Awakening

Within a cavern permeated by a potent scent of iron...

A young man sat, cross-legged, eyes shut tight, as still as a statue.

Before him lay an empty basin, remnants of crimson liquid lingering at its base, akin to the blood of some otherworldly creature.

As he stirred from his trance, confusion clouded his gaze.

"Where... where am I?" Zhang Chen's last recollection was of an all-night gaming session at home.

Lost in the immersive world of a popular cultivation game, Zhang Chen faced formidable challenges. Yet, the game's perilous exercises threatened his very existence.

Unable to overcome the trials, he resorted to a cheat modifier, only to find himself plunged into darkness and awakening in this unfamiliar realm.

"Have I... transmigrated?"

Gazing upon the strange surroundings and foreign form, Zhang Chen reluctantly accepted his newfound reality.

Then, a surge of unfamiliar memories flooded his mind, unsettling him deeply.

This world was one of immortal cultivation, where gods, immortals, demons, and spirits roamed.

Divided between the righteous and the malevolent, cultivators clashed, vying for supremacy and resources.

The previous inhabitant of his body bore the name Zhang Chen, an outer disciple of the Demon Sect known as the Blood God Sect.

Their arcane art, the "Blood Nerve," thrived on blood consumption, promising immortality with each drop ingested.

However, it harbored a dark secret - practitioners were prone to madness and violence, a risk that often led to their demise.

Despite the allure of rapid advancement, the Blood Nerve's perils loomed large, threatening the very essence of one's being.

Now burdened with the original owner's fate, Zhang Chen faced a dire deadline: attain the fifth level of Qi training within a month or face the grisly fate of becoming a mere blood slave.

His heart raced with fear, regret, and urgency as he grappled with his grim reality.

Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged - a cheat modifier embedded within his consciousness.

Activated by his desperate plea, the modifier offered a reprieve, nullifying the Blood Nerve's deadly side effects.

Empowered by this newfound assurance, Zhang Chen contemplated his next move.

With the system's assurance, he dared to entertain the notion of advancing through unrestricted blood consumption.

However, doubts gnawed at his resolve, urging caution and skepticism.

To verify the modifier's efficacy, Zhang Chen resolved to conduct experiments, starting with the manipulation of his newfound physical prowess.

Embracing his augmented strength, he marveled at his newfound might, reveling in the sensation of power coursing through his veins.

His true potential, however, lay in the cultivation of his Blood Spirit Power, a fusion of spiritual essence and corporeal blood.

As he channeled this power, crimson tendrils enveloped him, a testament to his burgeoning abilities.

With a simple gesture, he molded his blood into various forms, marveling at the potential for devastation it held.

A single drop launched towards a nearby wall, unleashing a concussive blast that left a sizable indentation in its wake.

Giddy with excitement, Zhang Chen contemplated the untapped potential of his newfound prowess.

Yet, beneath his enthusiasm lay a daunting realization - the journey ahead would be fraught with peril and uncertainty.

Undeterred, he embraced his newfound identity as a cultivator, a sorcerer in a world teetering on the edge of chaos.

As he pondered the trials that lay ahead, Zhang Chen's resolve hardened, his determination unwavering amidst the uncertainty of his fate.

Chapter 1: magic apprentice

In the cave full of strong **** smell.

A young man sat cross-legged, his eyes closed, motionless, like a stone statue.

There is an empty basin in front of him, and there is still red liquid on the bottom of the basin, which looks like the blood of some kind of creature.

After a while, the boy suddenly opened his eyes and looked around in confusion.

"Where is this place?" Zhang Chen remembered that he was playing games at home all night.

It was a very popular cultivation game recently, and it was very difficult. The main reason was that the exercises in the game had serious side effects, and they could die at any time.

He couldn't pass the level after playing all night, so he downloaded a modifier and prepared to cheat.

But just after downloading it, before I could use it, my eyes went dark and I lost consciousness, and when I opened my eyes again, I came here.

"Am I transmigrating?"

Looking at the unfamiliar environment and body in front of him, Zhang Chen had to accept the fact that he had traveled through.

Immediately afterwards, a strange memory appeared in his mind, and Zhang Chen's face suddenly became ugly.

This is a world of cultivating immortals, with gods, immortals, demons and ghosts.

Immortal cultivators are divided into two camps, righteous way and evil way.


The two attacked each other and robbed resources.

The original owner was also called Zhang Chen, an outer disciple of the Blood God Sect of the Demon Dao.

The technique of the Blood God Sect is called "Blood Nerve", and it needs to be practiced by devouring blood. When practiced to the highest level, it can be reborn from a drop of blood, immortal.

In addition, the blood nerve also has a special effect, practitioners can devour each other's blood, perfectly absorbing each other's cultivation.

For practitioners of blood nerves, other practitioners are the panacea for walking.

Although the Blood God Sect forbids disciples to kill each other, many people take risks in private.

Since it is a demon way, it is natural to act evil and deviant.

Of course, the Blood God Sect is not completely cultivating disciples, but also raising "pigs".

Disciples who are unable to break through the realm within the specified time will be judged as having poor aptitude and not worthy of training, deprived of their status as disciples, and demoted to blood slaves.

From then on, he couldn't help himself, and his blood was drawn every day for other disciples to practice.

Outer disciples practice with the blood of monsters, inner disciples use the blood of outer disciples, direct disciples use the blood of inner disciples, and sect elders use the blood of direct disciples.


Layer after layer, support the topmost people.

Survival of the fittest, magic gate is so cruel.

If you don't want to become a blood slave, you have to keep getting stronger and show the value of being cultivated by the sect.

Everyone in the Blood God Sect practiced non-stop, for fear of becoming blood-eating.

In order to break through the realm within the specified time, the original owner took the risk of devouring a lot of demon blood.

It's a pity that the ferocity in the demon blood could not be eliminated, causing the ferocity to rush into the brain and the consciousness dissipated.

The practice of the magic way is fast and powerful, but it will cause endless troubles, and if you are not careful, you will die.

"According to the memory of the original owner, I still have one month left. If I fail to break through to the fifth level of Qi training within one month, I will be drained of blood and become a resource for inner disciples to practice."

Zhang Chen's expression changed, sometimes fearful, sometimes regretful, sometimes anxious.


He had fantasized countless times about cultivating immortals, flying into the sky and escaping from the earth, and living forever, but he would rather not have this kind of situation.

With the aptitude of this body, it is almost impossible to break through the fifth level of Qi training within a month, so the original owner took the risk of swallowing a large amount of demon blood.

He also thought about running away, but the entire Blood God Sect was covered by a formation, and he couldn't get out without a token.

"Unless I have cheats." Zhang Chen was a little desperate.

【Ding! The modifier is activated. 】

It seemed to be responding to Zhang Chen. As soon as he finished speaking, a mechanical voice came from his mind.

【Please wait a moment, the system is scanning...】

"Cheater, I really have a cheater!" Zhang Chen was so excited, he didn't expect that the modifier he downloaded would travel along with him.

[Detected the technique "Blood Nerve", relying on devouring blood to practice]

[Side effects: easily affected by the spirit contained in the blood, becoming bloodthirsty, bloodthirsty, mad, and even brain dead]

【Please wait a moment, the system is being modified...】

【Ding! The modification is complete, and the side effects are cancelled]


"So, in the future, I can devour the demon blood to practice at will without any side effects?"

"Okay, it's really great, it's worthy of being a modifier!" Zhang Chen was ecstatic.

After a while, he calmed down and regained his composure.

If it is true as the system said, as long as he has enough demon blood, it is not difficult for him to break through the fifth level of Qi training.

But he has no confidence in his heart, and he can't believe what the system says.

In order to avoid the same fate as the original owner, it is necessary to conduct experiments to confirm whether the modifier is really effective.

A disciple of the Blood God Sect can receive a bowl of demon blood for training every day, and it just so happens that he did not receive his share of demon blood today.

However, before that, he was going to get acquainted with the body first.

"I feel like I could kill a cow with one punch!"

Zhang Chen clenched his fist excitedly and waved it towards the air.

This body has four levels of qi training, which is very weak in the original owner's memory. After all, there are too many people in the sect who are stronger than him, and they belong to the lowest level.


But for Zhang Chen, who is an ordinary person, it is like an ordinary person suddenly becomes a superman.

Strong, really too strong!

The strengthening of the body is only incidental, and the real ability is the blood spirit power cultivated.

The spiritual power cultivated by the blood nerves is fused with the blood, and the blood in the body is the means of attack and cultivation.

Zhang Chen ran his blood nerves a little strangely, UU reading www. uukanshu.com Mobilize the blood and spiritual power in the body.

The blood in the body suddenly surged, as if it was alive, full of spirituality.

Immediately afterwards, a large amount of blood overflowed from the pores, rendering Zhang Chen a blood man.

It can be said that it is indeed a magic technique, and it looks very evil and terrifying.

When Zhang Chen raised his hand, the blood quickly gathered in the palm of his hand like wriggling jelly, forming a sphere.

Miraculously, there was no blood stain on the clothes on his body.

With Zhang Chen's thought, the blood began to change shape in his hand.

Knives, guns, swords, halberds... It's a lot of fun to play.

"Try the power again."

With a wave of Zhang Chen's hand, a drop of blood shot towards the stone wall in front of him.


"boom!"

There was a flash of red light, and there was a thumb-sized, ten-centimeter-deep hole in the wall.

"This power is comparable to bullets, right? It's just that the fourth level of Qi training is so strong, how strong should it be at the foundation building stage, Jindan stage, and Nascent Soul stage?"

Zhang Chen's eyes lit up, and his heart was fascinated.

And according to the memory of the original owner, he hasn't learned spells yet. This is just the most basic use of blood spirit power. If he uses spells to attack, the power can be several times greater.

In the foundation building stage, various attributes and abilities can be added to the blood, the most common being highly poisonous.

The blood is highly poisonous, and ordinary people will die if they touch it.

I heard that there is a Jindan elder in the Blood God Sect who poisoned a whole city with a drop of blood.

"From now on, I am also a cultivator."

"No, it should be said to be a magician."

Looking at the scarlet blood in his hand, Zhang Chen sighed softly.

With a thought, the blood was re-absorbed into the body, and he could clearly feel that the blood was less, which should be the consumption just now.



---------
Chapter 1 The end is coming

 Ye Fan is a person who knows how to enjoy himself.

﻿﻿The so-called self-enjoyment means that you can have fun by yourself.

 If it sounds good, it’s called self-pleasure; if it sounds bad, it’s heartless. I don’t know what is sadness and what is anger.

 As long as you give him a mobile phone or a computer, he can temporarily forget all his worries and enter his own world.

﻿However, being happy does not mean being brainless. In fact, Ye Fan is very smart.

﻿Just because he was admitted to the Industrial University in City H is enough to prove that he, a seemingly inconspicuous person, has a high IQ.

﻿His being able to go to school can be regarded as a proud ancestor in his family. His hometown is in a township in S city, and he is definitely considered a highly educated person in the town.

 Leaving his parents to study in H city, Ye Fan did not live on campus. Instead, he found an old-fashioned rental building with a small bungalow outside the school, which was convenient for going to school and working part-time at the same time.

 The family conditions are not very good, and Ye Fan earns half of his schooling expenses by working.

﻿Going to school, working, and playing games, this is basically Ye Fan’s entire life.

﻿Don’t ask for money from your family, and try your best not to ask for money. My parents are both working hard, and their salary is not high. I also have a sister who is a sophomore in high school and is also in school, so the conditions are not well-off.

 But this time, Ye Fan could no longer hold on.

 In the military training after the university started, Ye Fan performed well.

﻿﻿Children from rural areas have poor physical fitness. In addition, he is also willing to exercise. On the way to school and work, Ye Fan relies on running. Compared with urban young people of the same age, his physique is definitely excellent.


 But on the last day of military training, Ye Fan was injured and sprained his foot while competing for first place.

It is more serious, and it needs to be raised at least a week.

﻿﻿He was fixed in the school doctor's office and given some bone-setting medicine, and was sent back to the rental building by his classmates.

 You may be able to recover faster in the hospital, but the cost is too high.

﻿﻿Ye Fan has some food in the rental building. Food is expensive nowadays. A basket of steamed dumplings and rice porridge costs more than ten yuan. He basically cooks and eats by himself.

 After returning home, Ye Fan had a rare period of rest and became a homebody.

﻿The house is only over thirty square meters. Nowadays, new buildings rarely have such a small house. In addition to the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, there is only a small living room.

 There is no TV in the living room, just a computer.

 The refrigerator at home belongs to the landlord, and only this computer belongs to Ye Fan himself.

 It is an old-fashioned chassis and a second-hand LCD screen. The price is very low, but the configuration of the chassis is pretty good and the game can be played smoothly.

﻿The hard drive contains many single-player games that Ye Fan has downloaded. Playing online games now is a waste of time, and you don’t have to spend money to become a VIP. You are basically being abused. Ye Fan doesn’t like the feeling of being abused, so he rarely plays online games.

 Playing a single game in your spare time can also be considered as relaxing.

Holding a mop pole in his hand, Ye Fan limped to the chair in front of the computer.


 Opening the web page, Ye Fan saw the news that had flooded the screen in the past few days.

“Dear viewers, according to meteorological reports, the meteor shower from the Andromeda Nebula will continue to come, and can be clearly observed in the coastal areas of our country.”

“The meteor shower has lasted for three days, which is unique in the entire history of Blue Sea Star. The last meteor shower of this scale may have been traced back to the Cretaceous Period.”

﻿The meteor shower started appearing three days ago. There were no particularly large meteorites and they would not cause any impact on the ground of Blue Sea Star, so no countries around the world took any countermeasures.

﻿﻿But Ye Fan felt that there was always a faint sour smell in the air these days, and he didn't know if it had something to do with the meteor shower.

  Browsing the forums I usually read, many people are discussing meteor showers these days.

“I’m on the southern coast, and watching the meteor shower here at night is particularly beautiful.”

"I don't know what's going on. My dog ​​has been very irritable these days. He doesn't like to eat and keeps barking. I don't know if it's in estrus? I'm looking for a female dog. I'm waiting online. My home address is XXXX.”

“They say that if you make a wish when you see a shooting star, it will come true, but there are so many shooting stars these days, what if the wish is obviously not enough?”

﻿﻿Ye Fan was a little bored after watching it for a while, and he didn’t want to use his mobile phone to team up with others to play black games. He might as well play a game on the hard disk.

 There were many game icons on the desktop, and he clicked on the red alert icon.


 This is a second-generation game called Glory of Nations, in which you can choose various countries to fight.

﻿﻿As a person from Qin and Han Dynasties, Ye Fan’s favorite language is also Qin and Han Dynasties.

﻿﻿This country has several superior arms, one is the Black Hawk fighter jet, one is the Apocalypse main station tank, one is the aircraft carrier, and the other is the army soldier.

 Fighters have strong bombing capabilities. Although the cost is high, a fighter formation can destroy any building.

 The main station tank also has the highest cost, but it has both ground attack and air defense capabilities. It is the absolute king of one-on-one land combat.

 An aircraft carrier can carry up to ten bombers and allow them to get close to the land, which is a nightmare for land construction.

﻿﻿Army soldiers are the most cost-effective unit. Especially after rising to a star, ground combat is simply a BUG.

﻿There are many other arms that Ye Fan likes. Each country has its own advantages, but it is sometimes very helpless to only choose one country.

 Start the game and create a map.

“Let’s take an extreme challenge. The biggest map has all the countries. They are ruthless enemies with super weapons. Let’s see how many minutes I can hold on.”

﻿﻿Ye Fan has never passed this game mode. The only fun is to see how long he can persist.

 The game started, and Ye Fan immediately operated quickly, placing base vehicles, building power plants, mining, and building barracks.

 Just did it twice, and an accident happened.

 The sky outside the window was bright.

﻿It is now 12 o'clock at noon. It is a bit cloudy today, but it is very bright now!

 The brightness is abnormal!

﻿﻿Ye Fan looked up out of the window in surprise and found that the entire sky was occupied by a dense meteor shower.


"what happened?"

﻿A strong sour smell swept over him. Even if Ye Fan closed the window, he couldn't stop it and filled the air.

﻿﻿The strong stinging pain penetrated into his mind, and Ye Fan couldn't help but lower his head suddenly, biting his lip until it bled.

 But the pain was unstoppable, and it only lasted for a few seconds before Ye Fan fainted.

﻿Before he passed out, he instinctively grabbed the mouse in one hand and pressed the keyboard with the other hand. He fell to the ground and overturned the computer.

﻿﻿The power supply of the old-fashioned rental building was exposed. When the computer was turned over, a spark flashed, and light blue current rushed to Ye Fan.

　　************

By the time Ye Fan woke up, ten hours had passed.

 “Uh...what’s going on?”

 Rubbing his bruised forehead, he could barely recall what happened before the fall.

“I was playing games, and then suddenly a large meteor shower fell, and a sour smell came in, and I couldn’t remember anything.”

 “My head hurts a little, and my feet hurt even more.”

﻿﻿The sprained ankle hurt even more. As soon as Ye Fan touched his ankle, he saw that his computer had been smashed to pieces.

﻿The computer monitor looked as if it had been burned by fire, it was pitch black and scorched.

 The power cord was pulled out of the wall. It looked like it was caused by a fall.

“No, I don’t know if the leakage protector has tripped. If there is a short circuit, it will be troublesome.”

﻿It’s not a big deal if the computer breaks down. It’s not worth anything anyway. If the circuit burns out, the landlord will be responsible for repairing it.


﻿﻿Ye Fan raised his head and saw that the light was on, and felt a little more at ease.

 “What’s wrong? Your reaction is slow?”

 While looking at the light, he also saw the clock on the wall. The time should be eleven o'clock in the evening.

﻿He reluctantly got up, stood up and went to the window to look down, because he felt that something was wrong today.

The voice-activated light in the courtyard of the community was on. Through the light, he saw that the community was in a mess. Some battery cars and bicycles belonging to nearby neighbors were lying on the ground in a mess.

Pieces of bright red blood almost covered the yard like splashed ink, and there were even some broken limbs and white bones with flesh and blood hanging on them.

 Some scraps of newspapers and plastic bags were flying in the air, but otherwise there was almost no movement.

“What is going on? A murder scene? But this scene is too big!”

﻿﻿Ye Fan didn't think about calling the police immediately. He wanted to find out what was going on.

 Open your eyes and look carefully.

 In a corner, a group of people were lying there, as if they were eating.

﻿His eyesight was good and he could clearly see the person in the corner who had been eaten until almost all he had left was his feet.

﻿One of them grabbed a piece of flesh and roared excitedly. The mutilated cheek and the blood stains on his face proved that he was no longer a human being.

﻿﻿A cold air rushed straight to his forehead, and Ye Fan shrank back into the room.

 “This is...this scene...resident evil!”

As a college student in the new era, Ye Fan has naturally seen many similar videos. The people eating now are clearly zombies!

﻿ He ​​didn't think this was a joke or a prank game. No one would create such a big scene to prank a student of his. All of this was true.


 After a brief panic, he became worried. He immediately took out his cell phone and called his parents.

 The phone cannot be reached.

 Calling my sister, I also couldn’t get through.

I took out my mobile phone and looked at it. The 4G signal on it has changed to 2G, which is almost equivalent to no signal.

 “In the end, this kind of thing will really happen, it’s bad.”

﻿﻿Ye Fan was a little nervous, but he forced himself to calm down. Being nervous now would not help.

 Trying to calm down his breathing and heartbeat, he knew that he should be a survivor in his current situation.

 There is no Internet and no knowledge of the outside world. What should you do next?

﻿Although he didn't have a clue for a while, he gradually calmed down.

Just when his heartbeat returned to normal, a voice suddenly sounded in his head.

"Brain wave analysis...normal...heartbeat analysis...normal...blood pressure analysis...normal, meets the binding conditions."

“Locked the candidate for commander, blood type binding...DNA binding...binding successful, confirmed to have the highest command authority.”

﻿﻿Ye Fan was stunned. The voice came out very strangely. There was no one else in the room, but everything was clearly audible. It was still a female voice that sounded very elegant.

"who is it?"

 “I am your personal secretary and assistant Nana, good evening! Your Excellency, the handsome lame commander.”

﻿ Laijiaqun (151858250) who likes this book, issues such as base construction, unit naming, and scientific and technological research and development are currently under heated discussion.
